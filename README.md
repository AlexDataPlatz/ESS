# ESS 

First attempt to get overview of immigration opinions across ESS responding countries

Create 3 classes of respondent according to immigration preferences: 1. open, 2. selective, 3. restrictive.
First calculate and plot aggregate class sizes for all rounds.
Next calculate and plot class size for all rounds/ individual countries, 
in this case, the 14 countries which responded to continuous sequence of rounds
(nb missing data for Estonia round 1 (2002) and Hungary round 9 (2018))

Feel free to use or adapt this code to do good things.
